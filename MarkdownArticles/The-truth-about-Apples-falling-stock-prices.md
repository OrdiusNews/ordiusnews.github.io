On January the 2nd, Tim Cook sent out a letter to investors explaining that there were fewer iPhone upgrades then they expected. That basically explains that they had sold fewer iPhones than expected and that there was weaker demand from China. That last part is interesting, as I went on a trip around China in 2017 and it seemed that everyone had iPhones. Recently, Chinese phone manufacturers like Oppo and Xiaomi have released phones for really good prices, meaning that it’s becoming quite hard for Apple to compete with those prices. So one reason for the falling sales in China could be because too many people are moving over to cheaper Android alternatives.

I do also think that there may be another reason. As explained in this recent YouTube video by Polymatter, another reason could be that people are mostly happy with their current phone and have no good reason to move, especially if the new Apple phones seem to have not much changing in them.

I personally think it’s a combination of both, but what do you think?
